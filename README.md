# üç≥ CookIt ‚Äî Cooking & Diet Planning Web App

## Overview

CookIt is a full-stack web application for managing recipes and personalized diet plans.  
Built using JavaScript, PHP, HTML, CSS, and MySQL with XAMPP, the app allows users to register, login, search and manage recipes, and create diet plans.

This project was created with the help of GitHub Copilot by giving it clear instructions, which it used to generate the code.

## How to Run Locally

1. Install and launch **XAMPP**. Start the **Apache** and **MySQL** services.  
2. Place the `CookIt` project folder inside the `htdocs` directory (e.g., `C:\xampp\htdocs\CookIt`).  
3. Open your browser and go to `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`.  
4. Create a new database (e.g., `cookit_db`) and import the provided SQL file to set up tables and initial data.  
5. Open `index.html` in your browser through the link: `http://localhost/CookIt/index.html`.  
6. **Important:** If the app loads a remote or Google-hosted page, update all links in the HTML and PHP files to use `http://localhost/CookIt/index.html`. This ensures full functionality.
